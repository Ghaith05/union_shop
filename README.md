# Union Shop (Flutter)

Union Shop is an e-commerce Flutter application that demonstrates an online shop with collections, product pages, a shopping cart with persistence, and authentication.

This README explains how to set up, run, and contribute to the project, and includes a short reference of the project's structure and key files.

## Features
- Static and dynamic pages: homepage, collections, collection detail, product pages
- Product options: size, color, quantity (variants optional per product)
- Shopping cart with add/remove/update and local persistence (SharedPreferences)
- Optional Firestore sync for logged-in users (merge strategy)
- Authentication UI and Firebase integration (email + Google sign-in)
- Search system (local search over sample products)
- Responsive UI with desktop and mobile layouts

## Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>= stable channel). Install from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- Git
- For web testing: Chrome browser
- (Optional) A Firebase project for auth and Firestore if you want server sync

Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd union_shop
```

Install dependencies

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

If you want Firebase features (auth / Firestore):

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Add a Web app and copy the config
3. Run `flutterfire configure` or update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your project's values

Run the app

```powershell
flutter run -d chrome    # run in web (Chrome)
flutter run              # run on a connected device or emulator
```

Notes

- If you make changes to `pubspec.yaml` run `flutter pub get` again.
- If you update platform code (android/ios) consider running a clean build: `flutter clean` then `flutter run`.

## Usage

Key user flows

- Browse collections from the homepage or Shop navigation.
- Open a product page to view images, select options (size/color) and quantity, then Add to cart.
- View the Cart page to update quantities, remove items, or clear the cart.
- Sign in via the Account icon to enable optional server-side cart sync (Firestore).
- Use the Search icon (top-right) or Footer → Search to open the Search page and type queries (title, description, category). Visiting Search with an empty query shows all sample products.

- Checkout / Pay page: Open the Cart and press the Pay button (or visit the `/pay` route) to open the Checkout flow. The Checkout page shows a contact input (key: `pay-contact`), an order summary with line items and the cart total, and a primary Pay button (key: `pay-button`). Pressing Pay triggers a simple demo flow that clears the cart, shows an "Order placed" snackbar, and returns the app to the home screen. There is a widget test for this flow at `test/pay_page_test.dart`.

Configuration options

- `lib/firebase_options.dart`: Firebase configuration (auto-generated by FlutterFire or editable manually).
- `lib/data/sample_data.dart`: sample products and collections used by the app.

Screenshots

Include screenshots in `assets/screenshots/` and reference them here. Example:

![Search page screenshot](assets/images/screenshots/search_example.png)

## Running Tests

Unit and widget tests are located under `test/`.

Run all tests:

```powershell
flutter test
```

Run a single test file:

```powershell
flutter test test/search_service_test.dart
```

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that can post LCOV coverage reports for PRs (`.github/workflows/lcov-report.yml`).

## Project Structure & Technologies

- `lib/` — app source code
  - `main.dart` — application entry and routes
  - `views/` — screens/pages (home, product, collections, cart, search, auth)
  - `widgets/` — shared widgets (navbar, footer, etc.)
  - `data/` — models, sample data, services (cart, auth)
  - `services/` — small services such as `search_service.dart`
  - `models/` — domain models (e.g., `product.dart`)
- `test/` — unit and widget tests
- `assets/` — images and static assets
- `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies and assets

Key packages used

- flutter (SDK)
- firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore — optional Firebase features
- shared_preferences — local persistence for the cart

Development tools

- Flutter SDK and the `flutter` CLI
- Optional: `flutterfire` CLI for generating `firebase_options.dart`

## How the README Was Built (meta)

This README follows a recommended structure for project front pages:

1. Project Title and Description — clear title and short explanation of purpose.
2. Installation and Setup Instructions — prerequisites, clone, install, how to run.
3. Usage Instructions — main user flows and configuration options.
4. Project Structure and technologies used — quick developer reference.
5. Contact Information — who to reach out to for questions.

Keeping README up to date is important — update it each time you add or remove major features.
